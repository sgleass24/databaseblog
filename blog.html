            <h2><strong>More on Normalization</strong></h2>
            <p>

                <strong>First Normal Form (1NF)</strong>
                First normal form (1NF) sets the fundamental rules for an organized database:
                Eliminate duplicative columns from the same table.
                Create separate tables for each group of related data and identify each row with a unique column or set
                of
                columns (the primary key).
                <br>
                <strong>Second Normal Form (2NF)</strong>
                Second normal form (2NF) further addresses the concept of removing duplicative data:
                Meet all the requirements of the first normal form.
                Remove subsets of data that apply to multiple rows of a table and place them in separate tables.
                Create relationships between these new tables and their predecessors through the use of foreign keys.
                <br>
                <strong>Third Normal Form (3NF)</strong>
                Third normal form (3NF) goes one significant step further:
                Meet all the requirements of the second normal form.
                Remove columns that are not dependent upon the primary key.
                <br>
                <strong>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF or 3.5NF)</strong>
                The Boyce-Codd Normal Form, also referred to as the "third and half (3.5) normal form," adds one more
                requirement:
                Meet all the requirements of the third normal form.
                Every determinant must be a candidate key.
                <br>
                <strong>Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</strong>
                Finally, fourth normal form (4NF) has one additional requirement:
                Meet all the requirements of the third normal form.
                A relation is in 4NF if it has no multi-valued dependencies.
                Remember, these normalization guidelines are cumulative. For a database to be in 2NF, it must first
                fulfill
                all
                the criteria of a 1NF database.

            <h2>More on SQL</h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                There are five types of SQL commands: DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and DQL.
                <br><br>
                <strong>DDL (Data Definition Language): </strong>
                <br>
                DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL commands that can be used to define the
                database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and
                modify the structure of database objects in the database.DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create,
                modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general
                user, who should be accessing the database via an application.
                <br>
                List of DDL commands:
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li>CREATE: This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function,
                    views, store procedure, and triggers).</li>
                <li>DROP: This command is used to delete objects from the database.</li>
                <li>ALTER: This is used to alter the structure of the database.</li>
                <li>TRUNCATE: This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the
                    records are removed.</li>
                <li>COMMENT: This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.</li>
                <li>RENAME: This is used to rename an object existing in the database.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>DQL (Data Query Language):</strong>
            <br>
            DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. The purpose of the DQL
            Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. We can define DQL as follows it is a
            component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it. It
            includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the data out of the database to perform
            operations with it. When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables the result is compiled into a further
            temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program i.e. a front-end.
            <br>
            List of DQL:
            <br>

            <li>SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.</li>

            <br>
            <strong>DML(Data Manipulation Language): </strong>
            <br>
            The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in the database belong to DML or Data
            Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL statement
            that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML statements.
            List of DML commands:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>INSERT : It is used to insert data into a table.</li>
                <li>UPDATE: It is used to update existing data within a table.</li>
                <li>DELETE : It is used to delete records from a database table.</li>
                <li>LOCK: Table control concurrency.</li>
                <li>CALL: Call a PL/SQL or JAVA subprogram.</li>
                <li>EXPLAIN PLAN: It describes the access path to data.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <strong>DCL (Data Control Language): </strong>
            <br>
            DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other
            controls of the database system.
            <br>
            List of DCL commands:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>GRANT: This command gives users access privileges to the database.</li>
                <li>REVOKE: This command withdraws the user’s access privileges given by using the GRANT command.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Though many resources claim there to be another category of SQL clauses <strong>TCL – Transaction Control
                Language</strong>. TCL commands deal with the transaction within the database.
            <br>
            List of TCL commands:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>COMMIT: Commits a Transaction.</li>
                <li>ROLLBACK: Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.</li>
                <li>SAVEPOINT:Sets a savepoint within a transaction.</li>
                <li>SET TRANSACTION: Specify characteristics for the transaction.</li>
            </ul>
